# NomadTraveler
Class project 1
For this project we went with a simple budget travel app targeted for the generation of travelers and nomads.

This app allows you to create a personal account, which allows you to search for the cheapest flights for your one way destination. You can save any trips in real-time and refer to them later. Nomad Traveler has can also add events  to your trip and eventually find your place to stay all in your personal data storage
